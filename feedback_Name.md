Hello,

It is a feedback about the "IBI feedback". 

From the feedback, I found that there are many details that I should pay more attention to optimize.
I printed the whole number in Practical5 task2. For Practical6, I added the pseudocode to explain my code and added title to my pie chart.
However, I do not understand one of the feedback in Practical6 task1 "the numbers change but the graph doesn't because it uses two different arrays.".
What's more, I checked my other Practical task and added some pseudocode to my code even though it is not required in Practical Guide.

Thanks for the feedback. It is really helpful.
